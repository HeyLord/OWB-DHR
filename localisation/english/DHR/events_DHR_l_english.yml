  nf_dhr.1.t:0 "A Reminder"
  nf_dhr.1.d:0 "Oliver entered the empty president's office with an elated mood. Despite everything, all those who had doubted the general, he had prevailed and Shady Sands had come under his control. Perhaps the title of "President General" was a bit too much, but Oliver wanted to savor the moment of his victory while he could. He wasn't going to be a dictator like Moore, Oliver would be sure to hold free elections as soon as the situation in California was more stable.\n\nTo his surprise, the president's office hadn't suffered much in all this chaos, only a few things lying on the floor, but overall the office was in order. One of the things lying on the floor caught Oliver's eye. It was a picture frame, but it was face down on the floor, and Oliver suddenly wondered what kind of picture was in it. Bending over and picking up the frame, Oliver turned it over to see the photograph.\n\nOliver knew that photograph. Moreover, a copy of this photograph was in the top left pocket of his uniform. The photo showed two friends, Aaron Kimball and Lee Oliver, in the days when they were still in the Army together. Oliver remembered well how Kimball had pulled a wounded Oliver from the battlefield, and so that he would never forget that moment, Oliver had offered to take a photo of the two of them together.\n\nHe forgot about that photo. How could he forget that? There was no trace of his old smile on Oliver's face. Aaron's dead. Why did the realization of this only come to him now? The thoughts and feelings in Oliver's head jumbled together and he began to feel worse and worse.\n\nOliver slowly walked over to the window of the president room.\nBurning buildings, soldiers breaking into houses looking for the remnants of Moore's soldiers, crying children not understanding all that was happening. Oliver finally saw it. All the things he had subconsciously tried to ignore"

  nf_dhr.5.d:0 "«Should I trust these charlatans?». That was the only thought on Oliver's mind as he waited for the meeting with Richard Goldman, the head of the Church of the Hubulogy. One one hand the rumors about them made them look like a shady cult, but on the other hand the Hubologists were the ones who, in the midst of the chaos in California,  were freely helping the war-torn civilians of California, which Oliver respected.\n\nA knock on the door sounded and Oliver invited the visitor inside.\n"Good day to you, Mr. President General. My name is Richard Goldman. My best friends call me Dick, and I feel that you and I can be the best of friends!"\n\n"I am most grateful to you, Mr. Oliver, for placing your trust in our organization! I suppose you've heard about the San Francisco incident and the Hubologists that were there, but I assure you, we're a completely different organization now!"\n\n"You heard how the Hubologists in San Francisco took away all the belongings of the poor people to join the organization, didn't you? I'll tell you, that's a lot of nerve! It is because of this kind of leadership that the Hubologists are treated as thieves and charlatans!"\n\n"What changed, you ask? Along came me, Richard Goldman, who had wanted to make the Hubologists something better since I was a kid. And so, after our (well-deserved) exile to Eureka, I took the reins, wanting to turn the Hubologists into a legitimate religious organization."\n\n"And so, seeing California in a state of bloody civil war..."\n\nThe flow of words kept pouring out of Dick's mouth, and Oliver began to feel himself falling asleep.\n\nFinally, Dick finished and with a smile on his face extended his hand to Oliver."

  nf_dhr.6.t:0 "Saucer In the Sky With Diamonds"
  nf_dhr.6.d:0 ""The tools are man-made, but the process is a gift from the Star Father through his prophet, The Hub.""\n\nRichard awakened from his deep slumber, in the observatory in which he had held a sermon the evening before in honor of the opening of the new temple. Dick had long ago noticed this dilapidated observatory, and having applied to the President General for funds, (during his pitch about which, as Richard observed, the President had fallen asleep) his request had been granted.\n\nDick had chosen this place not so much because of the location, but because of one thing that caught his eye. Almost untouched by time and war, a huge telescope beckoned Richard to it by its mere sight. Ever since he was a child, a desire to see the starry sky up close had been burning in him, and now it had finally come true.\n\nRichard, however, wanted to see more than just the stars. As a child, he once witnessed a miracle that he considered a blessing from his Star Father. On a dark night, Richard saw a bizarre round ship that flew over his head and disappeared in an instant. The apparition strengthened his faith in Hubology, but he didn't tell about it to anyone. He believed that the leaders were twisting Dick Hubbell's words, trying to profit from the people of the Wasteland, who would never have known the light of the Star Father if Richard had not come to power. There was no point in being angry with them now, Star Father had punished them, and only he, Richard Goldman, had risen as a true believer.\n\nSuddenly there was a loud explosion in the sky above Dick's head. Almost falling from his chair, he quickly reached for the telescope and what he saw in it threw Richard into a stupor.\nThe same bizarre round ship was falling from the sky, surrounded by fire. Dick could see the spot into which the ship was falling, and he reached excitedly for his radio."

But this was where he had realized himself as a general and later as a leader during the chaos in California.\n\nOliver coughed, pushing the nostalgia away from him and looked at the people who had gathered to await the unveiling of the new monument that stood behind Oliver, and he looked proudly at the culprit of the celebration.\n\nBefore there had been a monument to the friendship between the NCR and the Desert Rangers, but after the betrayal of Ranger General Mossman (and most likely Oliver's personal dislike of the Rangers), all the current Rangers had been recognized as traitors and disbanded, and the new Rapid Reaction Force under Oliver’s personal control had taken their place. And so one of Oliver's first acts after the Mojave was returned to NCR control was to destroy the monument and begin planning a new memorial worthy of California.\n\n"Californian Son", was how Oliver decided to call it. The monument depicted an NCR soldier with a little slave girl in his arms, that was one of the many victims of the Legion that our soldiers found. Oliver didn't consider himself an art person, but he was proud of how well his idea for the monument came to life.\n\nOliver coughed again, he had been in his musings for too long, you can't keep people waiting too long after all. Oliver adjusted his cap, and began his speech."

Oliver didn't know why he had decided to go to this Church of the Hubologists after all, he vaguely remembered signing the order to build it while Goldman buzzed in his ear describing the need to build a temple in the Hub.\n\nOliver wondered what can he expect from this visit, the outside of the Church was nothing special, but the view inside impressed him greatly. The murals on the walls with starry skies, colorful planets and strange alien creatures seemed to transport him to another world.\n\nOliver was invited to the special guests' area on the second floor, away from the rest of the faithful, and the ceremony began. The priest, whose name was AHS-6, as Oliver was told, began his speech. He congratulated the new faitful on their successful cleansing of the neurodynes ritual and began to tell the story of Dick Hubbell and the founding of the Hubologists to the newcomers.\n\nSitting and hearing all of this for the first time, one thought occurred to Oliver."

This time Oliver needed to go to Hoover Dam, but something stirred in him that made him want to make one stop along the way.\n\n"Californian Son" was more than just a name for a monument to the general. It was the ideal of a man, a true protector of California that Oliver had looked up to his entire life. Whether it was his appointment as commander-in-chief of the Mojave operation, his rescue of California from extremists, or his subsequent leadership and rebuilding of the country, Oliver always felt that he was getting closer and closer to being that "Californian Son" even a little bit.\n\nHowever, standing in front of the monument now, Oliver realized exactly how he really felt. Inferiority. Oliver felt inferior in the face of the monument, the ideal he had created. How far he was from the ordinary soldier depicted on the monument, hell, from any soldier in California. What was the point of everything Oliver had done anyway, if the ideal was still so far away from him?\n\nSomeone touched his shoulder and Oliver snapped out of his trance.\n\n"Are you okay Mr. President? We're late for the dam.""

In this snowy weather Oliver had the urge to go for a walk and putting on his jacket he went outside from his residence without anyone seeing him, he wanted to walk today without the bodyguards accompanying him.\n\nThe streets of Shady Sands looked beautiful, covered in white snow and tons of people strolled the streets enjoying the weather. It was hard for Oliver to enjoy the weather, his head was full of other thoughts, and he had never been one to stop and enjoy the beauty of nature. After walking a couple blocks, Oliver wanted to sit down, so he chose the first staircase he could find.\n\nOliver sat down and immediately heard a crowd of young men in military uniforms coming out of the building he was sitting on. Looking around to see which staircase he did sit down on, he saw a sign Oliver had made himself. "Aaron Kimball Military School." Oliver turned back around and looked thoughtfully at the young men coming out of the building.\n\n"Here they are, the Californian Sons," Oliver thought. And that thought made him feel warmer, for the first time in a long time.\n\nOliver held out his hand and watched the snowflakes fall on it. There were a lot of things on his mind, doubts, regrets. But all of that seemed to fade into the background as Oliver watched the snowflakes. There were many things he wanted to say, many things he wanted to do, or even change, if he could go back in time.\n\nBut right now he thought of only the one thing."

This car, Oliver was told, had been extremely popular before the war, and now California engineers were trying to find the best surviving versions of it and bring them back to working order. The engineers had decided to give one of the restored cars to their president and now Oliver was driving it, his Chrysalis Highwayman.\n\nOliver caught himself in a thought that made him smile. Even though times were tough, he had never felt so happy before. Perhaps it was the effect of his trip? No, Oliver realized, for the first time in his life he was pleased with himself. Not the type of pride he'd felt when he'd been appointed head of the Mojave Campaign, but real, genuine pride.\n\nOliver remembered that the engineers had told him something about a built-in radio system, and he decided to spend the rest of his trip listening to the song that, among all the other old-timey songs, he liked the most.\n\n§2"Regrets, I've had a few\nBut then again, too few to mention\nI did what I had to do\nAnd saw it through without exemption\nI planned each charted course\nEach careful step along the byway\nAnd more, much more than this..."§!"

The General continued his speech by saying that he understood the fear of the locals of the Legion forces that would undoubtedly take over Mojave as soon as the troops were withdrawn, and therefore announced a humanitarian operation in cooperation with the Followers, allowing all civilians to leave Mojave for California. California soldiers would securely guard the refugee convoys, Oliver promised. The general concluded by promising that he would not leave Mojave in the hands of the Legion and would return as soon as California was under his full control."
