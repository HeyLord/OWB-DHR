  ## Starting Focuses
  mot_dhr_californian_son:0 "Californian Son"
  mot_dhr_californian_son_desc:0 "Aaron Kimball once said, 'It is because of Californian-born men and women that Nevada and the New California Republic remain free and secure.' He was one of the first killed, or perhaps only went missing, when the chaos began. But I want to ensure that Californian sons and daughters are remembered for what they are. Heroes."
  mot_dhr_republic_call:0 "When the Republic Calls"
  mot_dhr_republic_call_desc:0 "New California is but a shell of its former glory. It took the collapse of the NCR for me to see it. But not anymore. When the Republic calls, men shall answer. When the Republic calls, women will bear arms. When the Republic calls, children will do all they can for their nation. When the Republic calls... I will be there to answer."


  mot_dhr_meet_the_senator:0 "Old Acquaintance"
  mot_dhr_meet_the_senator_desc:0 "I remember an Old World song. The first line said something about having forgotten old acquaintances. I made that mistake before. Many times over. But the Republic won't be rebuilt by a single man, and it can't survive by being divided. I suppose it's time to pay a visit to an old acquaintance myself."
  mot_dhr_followers_decree:0 "Followers Decree"
  mot_dhr_followers_decree_desc:0 "Had someone told me that I'd one day be asking Bill Calhoun, Follower of all Followers, for help, I'd have sent them up to the Frontier faster than someone asking for a nuclear winter. But here I am. Let's just hope he doesn't help in spawning another Caesar, if those rumors are true."
  mot_dhr_two_faced_benefactor:0 "Good Samaritan"
  mot_dhr_two_faced_benefactor_desc:0 "Flynn, Flynn, Flynn... of course he'd be one to make money hand over fist, even as the entire nation collapsed in front of him. Doesn't mean he's not going to try and put on a sad face for the hundreds of thousands without faith or hope. But it also doesn't mean he won't be smiling ear to ear when I tell him how he can get in on rebuilding the nation, and make a pretty cap at the same time."
  mot_dhr_spin_the_wheel:0 "Spin the Wheel"
  mot_dhr_spin_the_wheel_desc:0 "I've heard of these Hub types. Not the Hubbites versus Shadies schlock you'd hear about pre-collapse, this was old time religion stuff. Sky saucers, the universe rotating like a wheel, people being the spokes. Nonsense like that. They retreated up to Eureka after an incident in San Fran way back when, but when you get an offer to have them help rebuild your crippled nation, how could you refuse?"
  mot_dhr_cali_rd:0 "California R&D"
  mot_dhr_cali_rd_desc:0 "Even Hayes is getting in on this? I suppose it makes sense, he had founded the OSI just before everything went to hell, or at least he was going to. Well, since the Brotherhood aren't going to be our friends, let alone our research house, anytime soon, may as well reach out to the good governor, see if this kid he's found is as good as he says."
  mot_dhr_healing:0 "Healing the Wounds"
  mot_dhr_healing_desc:0 "It took a lot. Lots of money, lots of political power, lots of men. But we're finally recovering. We may not ever return to what the NCR once was. But we'll do it our own way. Without corruption. Without needless and unchallenged bureaucracy. Without gutless weaklings sending men to die for no other reason than because they felt like it. This time, we'll do it right."


  mot_dhr_inner_potential:0 "The Inner Potential"
  mot_dhr_inner_potential_desc:0 "'And the Star Father so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son a small loan of a trillion dollars. A loan all of us contribute to paying each time we are cleansed of our neurodynes.' Yeesh, who writes this drivel? Don't get me started on the "famous" 2 doz. eggs/Milk/TP work. Still, I can't refuse now... can I?"
  mot_dhr_first_church:0 "Journey from a Jar to the Sky"
  mot_dhr_first_church_desc:0 "Forgive me for intruding, friends, but have you heard the word of our great Star Father? You haven't? Well, for the low, low cost of... let's say free for right now, we can ensure each and every one will hear of his greatness! Where, you may ask? Why, in the Hub itself! But not that old town with all those filthy poor water merchants, no, in the high tower district. So we may all be just a bit closer to Him!"
  mot_dhr_golden_brahmin:0 "Golden Brahmin"
  mot_dhr_golden_brahmin_desc:0 "And the government, where hath it once been the end of all, must honor the Star Father, or else it shall fall. Well fallen it has. We looked for the elders, wondered where they could be, they were building a Golden Brahmin, as it ought to be! Now few shall question why the NCR fell, for if they ask, we need only point to our new source of prosperity and goodwill. All hail the Golden Brahmin!"
  mot_dhr_part_of_the_wheel:0 "Part of the Great Wheel"
  mot_dhr_part_of_the_wheel_desc:0 "You have the choice to live a joyless, meaningless existence in the rat race. Or you can come to a greater understanding of life through the Great Wheel. But children... aren't we all part of the Great Wheel at the end of the day? If not, prepared to be crushed in its spokes."

  mot_dhr_make_it_better:0 "We Can Make It Better"
  mot_dhr_make_it_better_desc:0 "Arcade keeps rambling on about how great it is to be working for an institution that encourages many of the same beliefs of the Followers, while also suspiciously denying any part in a 'fascist paramilitary organization' that may or may not have dabbled in the same things. Hayes tells me it's normal to have fears like Arcade's. I don't know why, but keep up the good work, you two!"
  mot_dhr_epa:0 "The Search For EPA"
  mot_dhr_epa_desc:0 "The Environmental Protection Agency (or Earth Protection Agency, our records are unclear) was said to have been lost, much of its research and facilities moved to a so-called 'TV-Town' long ago. Still, while we may never find the town, we can still find the facility, and hopefully it can teach us much of what we need to know to avoid making the ecological mistakes and disasters brought upon us by the NCR."
  mot_dhr_paradise:0 "The Lost Paradise"
  mot_dhr_paradise_desc:0 "Hayes has done it again, though this may be a challenge even for him. Apparently in the Pre-War days, there was a Garden of Eden production facility located in a Vault overseen by one Diana Stone. We don't have the men to spare to venture out anywhere near where the records say the Vault was located. But apparently the Vault is functional, and Hayes is preparing to send it an intranet communique to see if she's still alive. "
  mot_dhr_brighter_day:0 "A Brighter Day"
  mot_dhr_brighter_day_desc:0 "In spite of all odds, Arcade Gannon will go down in our revised history as being one of the greatest scientific minds California has ever produced or seen. He may just overtake me in leading this great nation one day, though I hope that day doesn't come too soon, I still have unfinished business to take care of."

  mot_dhr_patriotic_education:0 "Patriotic Education"
  mot_dhr_patriotic_education_desc:0 "Revision, schmevision. What the youth and all these illiterate wastelanders need is a good talking to. Spare me talk of 'honesty'. It didn't get the NCR anywhere, and it won't get us anywhere either. All they need to be taught is about how great the country they live in now is, how it never had any flaws, and if it did, to blame them on the previous administration. Simple."
  mot_dhr_rainy_day:0 "Just One Glass"
  mot_dhr_rainy_day_desc:0 "All of this administrative business, dealing with rebuilding a nation, managing the military, making sure I can go to sleep at night without fear of getting a bullet has made me thirsty. One drink can't hurt."
  mot_dhr_cali_dreamin:0 "§OCalifornia Dreaming§!"
  mot_dhr_cali_dreamin_desc:0 "All the leaves are brown... And the sky is gray... I've been for a walk... On a winter's day... I'd be safe and warm... If I was in L.A..."

  mot_dhr_hibernation:0 "Operation §R"Hibernation"§!"
  mot_dhr_hibernation_desc:0 "That damn Legion. They think they can just march in and demand our territory, after all I've done to get it back!? ...If that damned chaos in the NCR hadn't happened, I'd have raised my middle finger at them. But all my fingers do now are point the way forward and write down administrative jargon. This time... the finger will be pointing to retreat."
  mot_dhr_bear_trap:0 "Operation §g"Bear Trap"§!"
  mot_dhr_bear_trap_desc:0 "I may have given the order to retreat, but Caesar underestimates how much our men learned from the Desert Rangers. We'll teach them why I can truly be called 'Wait-And-See' when our men emerge from our desert bunkers to send Caesar back home. No, he deserves a grave now."
  mot_dhr_shall_not_pass:0 "Legion Shall Not Pass"
  mot_dhr_shall_not_pass_desc:0 "Our Army, our military police, our Rangers, it was them who made this all possible. And they will do it again. We'll push back at every front line, we'll build like we've never built before, we'll send the Legion back to with their tails between their legs, or without anything between their legs at all."
  mot_dhr_honeypot:0 "Operation §O"Honeypot"§!"
  mot_dhr_honeypot_desc:0 "Two incidents before the chaos in the NCR have come back to me recently. One, a riot at the NCRCF with prisoners using dynamite against the fine guards who were keeping them where they belonged. The second, an instance of a small town taking advantage of NCR soldiers and Legion soldiers looking for rest and relaxation on a sleazy mayor's dime. Let's see how the Legion like their spycraft turned against them."
  mot_dhr_opportunity:0 "Once In a Lifetime Opportunity"
  mot_dhr_opportunity_desc:0 "We've managed to disorient the Legion to the point of at least ensuring their forces are too preoccupied to do anything against us, at least not right away. We have only one shot at Caesar and that Legate of his. We're not going to waste it."
  mot_dhr_bear_roars:0 "The Bear Roars"
  mot_dhr_bear_roars_desc:0 "MEN! THIS DAY, YOU FIGHT NOT FOR THE NCR, NOT FOR ME, BUT FOR YOURSELVES! WOMEN, KICK CAESAR'S ASS BACK TO WHERE IT BELONGS, AND SEE THAT HE NEVER GETS UP AGAIN!"

  mot_dhr_steel_lady:0 "The Steel Lady"
  mot_dhr_steel_lady_desc:0 "Cassandra Moore... I never thought she'd turn against me. We could have made a great team. But the noose has already been set up. I suppose I'll try and reason with her one last time. Call me stubborn, but she could perform one last hurrah for the NCR... before she dies with it."
  mot_dhr_promotion:0 "Up For Promotion"
  mot_dhr_promotion_desc:0 "The good Captain managed to escape Vegas just as the chaos erupted in the NCR. During that time, she made quite a name for herself in keeping her men in line, and Vegas out of Legion hands. I think that calls for a promotion."
  mot_dhr_new_deal:0 "The New Deal"
  mot_dhr_new_deal_desc:0 "The Gun Runners and Crimson Caravan have always been competing against who truly supplies the Army of New California. Unfortunately for them, they no longer exist, so we're not obligated to pay them a dollar. But were we to negotiate with the Van Graffs and local Mojave gun makers, we might have ourselves a new unoffical branch of the Army."
  mot_dhr_steel_bear:0 "§gSteel Bear§!"
  mot_dhr_steel_bear_desc:0 "Since we no longer have that many politicians and Brahmin Barons insisting on protection for their assets, nor a citizenry who insist on 'human rights', we're free to utilize the many fusion cores and TX-28 MF packs we've collected from the Brotherhood over the years to ensure both our Salvaged and normal Power Armors are not only fully charged, but overcharged."
  mot_dhr_NCPD:0 "§2New California Police Department§!"
  mot_dhr_NCPD_desc:0 "You know, it was quite unclear to me in the past if there was a single unified police department for the whole of New California, or if each state or even town had their own separate departments, or law enforcement equivalents. No matter, when some lawbreaker hears 'Freeze, NCPD', they'll have only one name to remember now."
  mot_dhr_still_standing:0 "Still Standing"
  mot_dhr_still_standing_desc:0 "The sign of a well disciplined army is the ability to stand when everyone else is beaten and down for the count. My army has seen to it that even after the government, the people, and everything else went to hell in a handbasket, they still stood to pledge allegiance. Let's see to it that they not only stand the test of time, but the test of the Legion as well."
