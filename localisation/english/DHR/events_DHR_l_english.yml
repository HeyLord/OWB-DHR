  nf_dhr.26.d:0 ""President Oliver! We weren't warned of your arrival, come on in, we always have room for you, come this way."\n\nOliver nodded to the men in gray robes and followed them. Oliver didn't know why he had decided to go to this Church of the Hubologists after all, he vaguely remembered signing the order to build it while Goldman buzzed in his ear describing the need to build a temple in the Hub.\n\nOliver wondered what can he expect from this visit, the outside of the Church was nothing special, but the view inside impressed him greatly. The murals on the walls with starry skies, colorful planets and strange alien creatures seemed to transport him to another world.\n\nOliver was invited to the special guests' area on the second floor, away from the rest of the faithful, and the ceremony began. The priest, whose name was AHS-6, as Oliver was told, began his speech. He congratulated the new faitful on their successful cleansing of the neurodynes ritual and began to tell the story of Dick Hubbell and the founding of the Hubologists to the newcomers.\n\nSitting and hearing all of this for the first time, one thought occurred to Oliver."
