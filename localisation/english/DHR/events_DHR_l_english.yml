  nf_dhr.15.d:0 "Oh, warm Mojave air, that turns your throat into a desert, Oliver didn't expect to miss this hell on earth. But this was where he had realized himself as a general and later as a leader during the chaos in California.\n\nOliver coughed, pushing the nostalgia away from him and looked at the people who had gathered to await the unveiling of the new monument that stood behind Oliver, and he looked proudly at the culprit of the celebration.\n\nBefore there had been a monument to the friendship between the NCR and the Desert Rangers, but after the betrayal of Ranger General Mossman (and most likely Oliver's personal dislike of the Rangers), all the current Rangers had been recognized as traitors and disbanded, and the new Rapid Reaction Force under Oliver’s personal control had taken their place. And so one of Oliver's first acts after the Mojave was returned to NCR control was to destroy the monument and begin planning a new memorial worthy of California.\n\n"Californian Son", was how Oliver decided to call it. The monument depicted an NCR soldier with a little slave girl in his arms, that was one of the many victims of the Legion that our soldiers found. Oliver didn't consider himself an art person, but he was proud of how well his idea for the monument came to life.\n\nOliver coughed again, he had been in his musings for too long, you can't keep people waiting too long after all. Oliver adjusted his cap, and began his speech."

  nf_dhr.26.d:0 ""President Oliver! We weren't warned of your arrival, come on in, we always have room for you, come this way."\n\nOliver nodded to the men in gray robes and followed them. Oliver didn't know why he had decided to go to this Church of the Hubologists after all, he vaguely remembered signing the order to build it while Goldman buzzed in his ear describing the need to build a temple in the Hub.\n\nOliver wondered what can he expect from this visit, the outside of the Church was nothing special, but the view inside impressed him greatly. The murals on the walls with starry skies, colorful planets and strange alien creatures seemed to transport him to another world.\n\nOliver was invited to the special guests' area on the second floor, away from the rest of the faithful, and the ceremony began. The priest, whose name was AHS-6, as Oliver was told, began his speech. He congratulated the new faitful on their successful cleansing of the neurodynes ritual and began to tell the story of Dick Hubbell and the founding of the Hubologists to the newcomers.\n\nSitting and hearing all of this for the first time, one thought occurred to Oliver."
