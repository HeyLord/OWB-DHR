  mot_dhr_californian_son:0 "Californian Son"
  mot_dhr_californian_son_desc:0 "Aaron Kimball once said, 'It is because of Californian-born men and women that Nevada and the New California Republic remain free and secure.' He was one of the first killed, or perhaps only went missing, when the chaos began. But I want to ensure that Californian sons and daughters are remembered for what they are. Heroes."
  mot_dhr_republic_call:0 "When the Republic Calls"
  mot_dhr_republic_call_desc:0 "New California is but a shell of its former glory. It took the collapse of the NCR for me to see it. But not anymore. When the Republic calls, men shall answer. When the Republic calls, women will bear arms. When the Republic calls, children will do all they can for their nation. When the Republic calls... I will be there to answer."


  mot_dhr_meet_the_senator:0 "Old Acquaintance"
  mot_dhr_meet_the_senator_desc:0 "I remember an Old World song. The first line said something about having forgotten old acquaintances. I made that mistake before. Many times over. But the Republic won't be rebuilt by a single man, and it can't survive by being divided. I suppose it's time to pay a visit to an old acquaintance myself."
  mot_dhr_followers_decree:0 "Followers Decree"
  mot_dhr_followers_decree_desc:0 "Honestly, at first I wanted to label all Followers as traitors and kick them out of California. But the actions of their leader, Bill Calhoun, who until the very last moment, when he was struck by a stray bullet, helped the wounded on the battlefield, raised doubts in me. And then Wendell offered me a better idea, to dissolve the Followers as an organization and create a new one under state control. Thank you Wendell, I knew I could count on you for things like that."
  mot_dhr_two_faced_benefactor:0 "Good Samaritan"
  mot_dhr_two_faced_benefactor_desc:0 "Flynn, Flynn, Flynn... of course he'd be one to make money hand over fist, even as the entire nation collapsed in front of him. Doesn't mean he's not going to try and put on a sad face for the hundreds of thousands without faith or hope. But it also doesn't mean he won't be smiling ear to ear when I tell him how he can get in on rebuilding the nation, and make a pretty cap at the same time."
  mot_dhr_spin_the_wheel:0 "Spin the Wheel"
  mot_dhr_spin_the_wheel_desc:0 "I've heard of these Hub types. Not the Hubbites versus Shadies schlock you'd hear about pre-collapse, this was old time religion stuff. Sky saucers, the universe rotating like a wheel, people being the spokes. Nonsense like that. They retreated up to Eureka after an incident in San Fran way back when, but when you get an offer to have them help rebuild your crippled nation, how could you refuse?"
  mot_dhr_cali_rd:0 "California R&D"
  mot_dhr_cali_rd_desc:0 "Even Hayes is getting in on this? I suppose it makes sense, he had founded the OSI just before everything went to hell, or at least he was going to. Well, since the Brotherhood aren't going to be our friends, let alone our research house, anytime soon, may as well reach out to the good governor, see if this kid he's found is as good as he says."
  mot_dhr_healing:0 "Healing the Wounds"
  mot_dhr_healing_desc:0 "It took a lot. Lots of money, lots of political power, lots of men. But we're finally recovering. We may not ever return to what the NCR once was. But we'll do it our own way. Without corruption. Without needless and unchallenged bureaucracy. Without gutless weaklings sending men to die for no other reason than because they felt like it. This time, we'll do it right."


  mot_dhr_inner_potential:0 "The Inner Potential"
  mot_dhr_inner_potential_desc:0 "'And the Star Father so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son a small loan of a trillion dollars. A loan all of us contribute to paying each time we are cleansed of our neurodynes.' Yeesh, who writes this drivel? Don't get me started on the "famous" 2 doz. eggs/Milk/TP work. Still, I can't refuse now... can I?"
  mot_dhr_first_church:0 "Journey from a Jar to the Sky"
  mot_dhr_first_church_desc:0 "Forgive me for intruding, friends, but have you heard the word of our great Star Father? You haven't? Well, for the low, low cost of... let's say free for right now, we can ensure each and every one will hear of his greatness! Where, you may ask? Why, in the Hub itself! But not that old town with all those filthy poor water merchants, no, in the high tower district. So we may all be just a bit closer to Him!"
  mot_dhr_golden_brahmin:0 "Golden Brahmin"
  mot_dhr_golden_brahmin_desc:0 "And the government, where hath it once been the end of all, must honor the Star Father, or else it shall fall. Well fallen it has. We looked for the elders, wondered where they could be, they were building a Golden Brahmin, as it ought to be! Now few shall question why the NCR fell, for if they ask, we need only point to our new source of prosperity and goodwill. All hail the Golden Brahmin!"
  mot_dhr_part_of_the_wheel:0 "Part of the Great Wheel"
  mot_dhr_part_of_the_wheel_desc:0 "You have the choice to live a joyless, meaningless existence in the rat race. Or you can come to a greater understanding of life through the Great Wheel. But children... aren't we all part of the Great Wheel at the end of the day? If not, prepared to be crushed in its spokes."

  mot_dhr_make_it_better:0 "We Can Make It Better"
  mot_dhr_make_it_better_desc:0 "Arcade keeps rambling on about how great it is to be working for an institution that encourages many of the same beliefs of the Followers, while also suspiciously denying any part in a 'fascist paramilitary organization' that may or may not have dabbled in the same things. Hayes tells me it's normal to have fears like Arcade's. I don't know why, but keep up the good work, you two!"
  mot_dhr_epa:0 "The Search For EPA"
  mot_dhr_epa_desc:0 "The Environmental Protection Agency (or Earth Protection Agency, our records are unclear) was said to have been lost, much of its research and facilities moved to a so-called 'TV-Town' long ago. Still, while we may never find the town, we can still find the facility, and hopefully it can teach us much of what we need to know to avoid making the ecological mistakes and disasters brought upon us by the NCR."
  mot_dhr_paradise:0 "The Lost Paradise"
  mot_dhr_paradise_desc:0 "Hayes has done it again, though this may be a challenge even for him. Apparently in the Pre-War days, there was a Garden of Eden production facility located in a Vault overseen by one Diana Stone. We don't have the men to spare to venture out anywhere near where the records say the Vault was located. But apparently the Vault is functional, and Hayes is preparing to send it an intranet communique to see if she's still alive. "
  mot_dhr_brighter_day:0 "A Brighter Day"
  mot_dhr_brighter_day_desc:0 "In spite of all odds, Arcade Gannon will go down in our revised history as being one of the greatest scientific minds California has ever produced or seen. He may just overtake me in leading this great nation one day, though I hope that day doesn't come too soon, I still have unfinished business to take care of."

  mot_dhr_patriotic_education:0 "Patriotic Education"
  mot_dhr_patriotic_education_desc:0 "Revision, schmevision. What the youth and all these illiterate wastelanders need is a good talking to. Spare me talk of 'honesty'. It didn't get the NCR anywhere, and it won't get us anywhere either. All they need to be taught is about how great the country they live in now is, how it never had any flaws, and if it did, to blame them on the previous administration. Simple."
  mot_dhr_rainy_day:0 "Just One Glass"
  mot_dhr_rainy_day_desc:0 "All of this administrative business, dealing with rebuilding a nation, managing the military, making sure I can go to sleep at night without fear of getting a bullet has made me thirsty. One drink can't hurt."
  mot_dhr_cali_dreamin:0 "§OCalifornia Dreaming§!"
  mot_dhr_cali_dreamin_desc:0 "All the leaves are brown... And the sky is gray... I've been for a walk... On a winter's day... I'd be safe and warm... If I was in L.A..."

  mot_dhr_hibernation:0 "Operation §R"Hibernation"§!"
  mot_dhr_hibernation_desc:0 "That damn Legion. They think they can just march in and demand our territory, after all I've done to get it back!? ...If that damned chaos in the NCR hadn't happened, I'd have raised my middle finger at them. But all my fingers do now are point the way forward and write down administrative jargon. This time... the finger will be pointing to retreat."
  mot_dhr_bear_trap:0 "Operation §g"Bear Trap"§!"
  mot_dhr_bear_trap_desc:0 "I may have given the order to retreat, but Caesar underestimates how much our men learned from the Desert Rangers. We'll teach them why I can truly be called 'Wait-And-See' when our men emerge from our desert bunkers to send Caesar back home. No, he deserves a grave now."
  mot_dhr_shall_not_pass:0 "Legion Shall Not Pass"
  mot_dhr_shall_not_pass_desc:0 "Our Army, our military police, our Rangers, it was them who made this all possible. And they will do it again. We'll push back at every front line, we'll build like we've never built before, we'll send the Legion back to with their tails between their legs, or without anything between their legs at all."
  mot_dhr_honeypot:0 "Operation §O"Honeypot"§!"
  mot_dhr_honeypot_desc:0 "Two incidents before the chaos in the NCR have come back to me recently. One, a riot at the NCRCF with prisoners using dynamite against the fine guards who were keeping them where they belonged. The second, an instance of a small town taking advantage of NCR soldiers and Legion soldiers looking for rest and relaxation on a sleazy mayor's dime. Let's see how the Legion like their spycraft turned against them."
  mot_dhr_opportunity:0 "Once In a Lifetime Opportunity"
  mot_dhr_opportunity_desc:0 "We've managed to disorient the Legion to the point of at least ensuring their forces are too preoccupied to do anything against us, at least not right away. We have only one shot at Caesar and that Legate of his. We're not going to waste it."
  mot_dhr_bear_roars:0 "The Bear Roars"
  mot_dhr_bear_roars_desc:0 "MEN! THIS DAY, YOU FIGHT NOT FOR THE NCR, NOT FOR ME, BUT FOR YOURSELVES! WOMEN, KICK CAESAR'S ASS BACK TO WHERE IT BELONGS, AND SEE THAT HE NEVER GETS UP AGAIN!"

  mot_dhr_steel_lady:0 "The Steel Lady"
  mot_dhr_steel_lady_desc:0 "Cassandra Moore... I never thought she'd turn against me. We could have made a great team. But the noose has already been set up. I suppose I'll try and reason with her one last time. Call me stubborn, but she could perform one last hurrah for the NCR... before she dies with it."
  mot_dhr_promotion:0 "Up For Promotion"
  mot_dhr_promotion_desc:0 "The good Captain managed to escape Vegas just as the chaos erupted in the NCR. During that time, she made quite a name for herself in keeping her men in line, and Vegas out of Legion hands. I think that calls for a promotion."
  mot_dhr_new_deal:0 "The New Deal"
  mot_dhr_new_deal_desc:0 "The Gun Runners and Crimson Caravan have always been competing against who truly supplies the Army of New California. Unfortunately for them, they no longer exist, so we're not obligated to pay them a dollar. But were we to negotiate with the Van Graffs and local Mojave gun makers, we might have ourselves a new unoffical branch of the Army."
  mot_dhr_steel_bear:0 "§gSteel Bear§!"
  mot_dhr_steel_bear_desc:0 "Since we no longer have that many politicians and Brahmin Barons insisting on protection for their assets, nor a citizenry who insist on 'human rights', we're free to utilize the many fusion cores and TX-28 MF packs we've collected from the Brotherhood over the years to ensure both our Salvaged and normal Power Armors are not only fully charged, but overcharged."
  mot_dhr_NCPD:0 "§2New California Police Department§!"
  mot_dhr_NCPD_desc:0 "You know, it was quite unclear to me in the past if there was a single unified police department for the whole of New California, or if each state or even town had their own separate departments, or law enforcement equivalents. No matter, when some lawbreaker hears 'Freeze, NCPD', they'll have only one name to remember now."
  mot_dhr_still_standing:0 "Still Standing"
  mot_dhr_still_standing_desc:0 "The sign of a well disciplined army is the ability to stand when everyone else is beaten and down for the count. My army has seen to it that even after the government, the people, and everything else went to hell in a handbasket, they still stood to pledge allegiance. Let's see to it that they not only stand the test of time, but the test of the Legion as well."

  mot_dhr_expensive:0 "Expensive Venture"
  mot_dhr_expensive_desc:0 "So. As it turns out, overcharging Power Armor, especially the Salvaged kind, has more unwanted side effects than we had previously thought. On the good side of things, we can take the faulty or non-functional Power Armors we are now accumulating, and use them to build up some arms workshops. Just... be sure not to jostle them around too much, last thing we need is Shady going up in a nuclear fireball."
  mot_dhr_scraps:0 "Gather the Scraps"
  mot_dhr_scraps_desc:0 "Now that we've secured Lost Hills, we decided to blow it the hell up. That'll teach the Brotherhood for starting a war they could never win. Bad news, it means we've effectively lost access to the bunker and much of the technologies that could have come with it. Good news, we now have the ability to make our own non-Salvaged Power Armor!"
  mot_dhr_unthinkable:0 "The Unthinkable"
  mot_dhr_unthinkable_desc:0 "When Eureka declared war on us... or rather the NCR, we'd never have thought that it was the Enclave pulling the strings the whole time. Or at least a remnant that claims itself as not truly being the Enclave. Which leads me to probably making the hardest decision a New Californian has ever had to make: Forgiving the Enclave. It'll be unpopular, it'll be hated, but its what's best for us."
  mot_dhr_dream_come_true:0 "Dream Come True"
  mot_dhr_dream_come_true_desc:0 "Even better news! With the help of Enclave reclamation technologies, as well as the Power Armor resources they're 'willing' to share with us, we've managed to enhance our Power Armor potential capabilities. It does mean they'll spend a bit more time in the shop, but it's worth it when we can finally move on from T-45's and into T-51's!"

  mot_dhr_shady_hq:0 "Shady Sands HQ"
  mot_dhr_shady_hq_desc:0 "'Iustitia Omnium', that's the phrase a lot of officers have rallied around. Apparently Pre-War police organizations had slogans and mottos like 'To Protect and Serve', or 'Obey and Survive'. But we'll be better than they were. In memory of the Vault Dweller, we've set up construction of what will hopefully be the first of many precincts to come, starting with Precinct 13. Let's just hope the Khans, Vipers, or Jackals don't assault it anytime soon."
  mot_dhr_tough_as_pa:0 "Tougher Than Power Armor"
  mot_dhr_tough_as_pa_desc:0 "They say things are bigger in Texas, but we had no clue how much tougher they'd be either! We might have few friends outside the NCR, but one of Allgood Murphy's pals sent in a shipment of what we can only assume to be Vault-Tec issued riot gear. I guess no one got the memo that he's dead or missing. It seems to be the only one we'll get, so we're putting our top scientists on this to see just how much better we can make our gear."
  mot_dhr_richardson:0 "§GGreen Is Good§!"
  mot_dhr_richardson_desc:0 "To be honest, for a brief time in NCR history, the term 'President' was said with as much hatred and disgust as one would talk about a feral ghoul or a raging mutant. It died out quickly with the death of President Tandi, and the inferior administrations that came after her, but I'm probably one of the few to remember that period in time. We're better than the Enclave, but we haven't shown it enough to our mutant friends. Let's try harder."
  mot_dhr_against_all_evil:0 "Against All Evil"
  mot_dhr_against_all_evil_desc:0 "The eggheads have done quite a bit with that shipment we got. Not only have they managed to improve on the designs of the NCPD, but do so in a way that barely changes them from how they looked 40 years ago. Provided, the crooks they'll go after won't know that until they're wondering why an officer won't go down despite multiple gunshots, but we've also learned how to properly coordinate like Pre-War police. 'Iustitia Omnium' indeed."

  mot_dhr_kickstart_machine:0 "Kickstart the Machine"
  mot_dhr_kickstart_machine_desc:0 "The Californian War Machine began in Shady Sands, and it will never end. But Shady has suffered a lot of damage as of late, not to mention the collapse of government and infrastructure across New California. I've never been one to turn down a challenge though. If the NCR could get by when it was nothing more than a village, so too will we. Only difference is this village will be a lot better armed this time."
  mot_dhr_president_visit:0 "Visit From the President"
  mot_dhr_president_visit_desc:0 "I've been around doing nothing but General duties for the past couple months. I think it's high time I change that. I'm going to return to Shady Sands, not as a President-General, but as their President. After all, someone's got to keep a brave face in these trying times."
  mot_dhr_serve_cali:0 "To Serve California"
  mot_dhr_serve_cali_desc:0 "We've ousted most of the corrupt elements from our ranks, cleaned up our act by enhancing our military and military equipment, and rallied the men with brave words and a brave face. I think that calls for a celebration. Not of myself, but of the nation. For the first time in a long time, everyone can be proud to call themselves a Californian."

  mot_dhr_here_we_go:0 "Here We Go Again"
  mot_dhr_here_we_go_desc:0 "I swore to myself that we wouldn't make the mistakes of the NCR again, but here we are, imposing our authority on a far off land. A land farther than what we already considered foreign territory. It pains me to even suggest the idea, but we may have to call for all these places under Legion rule to be placed under another military occupation authority. Let's just hope we don't have it fall apart..."
  mot_dhr_bear_hug:0 "Bear Hug"
  mot_dhr_bear_hug_desc:0 "Caesar is gone. The Legion is gone. But its legacy will last years, decades even. We can't have that. We need to take a page out of Allgood's book and show the people, Californians and Arizonans alike, that California has returned, more prosperous than ever before. And I think I know some ways to do exactly that."
  mot_dhr_kill_bos:0 "The Scum of California"
  mot_dhr_kill_bos_desc:0 "Moore was a very controversial figure to the higher ups in her day, but one thing both her and Hayes agreed on was the threat of the Brotherhood. Moore isn't around anymore, but Hayes most certainly is. And he's drafted up ways that we can kill them six ways from Sunday. I only hope he's right."
  mot_dhr_sweet_mojave:0 "My Sweet Mojave"
  mot_dhr_sweet_mojave_desc:0 "I never thought I'd see the day that the Mojave was taken by a foreign power. And unfortunately, it was. In all my years of service, it was my greatest shame to have retreated. But look how far we've come. We rebuilt the nation. We crushed the Legion. We've regained the Mojave. There's something special about this place. I don't know what, but I swear to God I won't let anyone take it ever again."
  mot_dhr_ode_to_fallen:0 "Ode to the Fallen"
  mot_dhr_ode_to_fallen_desc:0 "The Hoover Dam Memorial. I'm surprised the Legion didn't blow it up when they had the chance. It's been shot at quite a bit, irked some private real bad. But I think I know of a way to appease the soldiers who lost someone in all this. The chaos of California, the retreat from the Mojave, the destruction of the Legion. It's time I make it up to them. All of them."
  mot_dhr_vegas:0 "Treaty of New Vegas"
  mot_dhr_vegas_desc:0 "That stupid treaty was negotiated by a bunch of spineless pansies who didn't know Tandi from Aradesh. House has been sitting in his high and mighty tower for too long. It's time to cut him and his 'Families' down to size."
  mot_dhr_dam_good:0 "It's Dam Good"
  mot_dhr_dam_good_desc:0 "The Legion managed to sabotage one major piece of infrastructure before we crushed them, the Hoover Dam. But thankfully, with the smartness of Hayes and that Arcade fella, we can not only fix the damage, we can localize it to Shady Sands, without need of immediately fixing turbines."
  mot_dhr_raise_the_flag:0 "Raise the Flag, Begin Again"
  mot_dhr_raise_the_flag_desc:0 "These past few years have made me question everything I know. Some days, I wonder if it was worth it at all. But then I look out at what me and my men have accomplished. And I think to myself, 'We did good'. I suppose it's time I consider stepping down, or at least staying out of the spotlight for a bit, but there's one more thing I need to do..."




  mot_dhr_wheel_of_fate:0 "The Wheel of Fate"
  mot_dhr_wheel_of_fate_desc:0 "Hello friends. My name is Richard Goldman. My best friends call me Dick. You aren't my best friends yet, but you could be. Won't you join me?"
  mot_dhr_come_fly_with_me:0 "Come Fly With Me"
  mot_dhr_come_fly_with_me_desc:0 "Some people think that China was a big bad Old World nation, but they weren't. You see, the Star Father had sent down a challenger down from the heavens to see if they could best the might of America. The Chinese, unfortunately, were not as pure as the Star Father had intended, and so they cheated. They cheated by becoming invisible. They cheated by soaring through the air in ships America had not yet made. They cheated by starting the War. The lesson is: Don't cheat."
  mot_dhr_similar_brainwaves:0 "Brainwaves of the Dreamers"
  mot_dhr_similar_brainwaves_desc:0 "Why didn't my predecessors figure out to use psykers for the cause of Hubology? They are rare, of course, but the spectacular tricks and their effect on minds outweigh the expense of finding them."

  mot_dhr_body_mind_spirit_desc:0 "Treating the good spokes as children, while the naysayers aren't given any kind of retribution, has come to be a problem. I must take a much more adult approach to our faith if I am to ensure the faith does not die should this nation fail once again."
  mot_dhr_oppressives:0 "Those Dirty Oppressives"
  mot_dhr_oppressives_desc:0 "The unenlightened refuse the zeta scans? Of course they would, they're but level 1 on the Aligned Hub Seeker scale. But what if there were a way to take care of them... more effectively? I shall see to it that the Star Father's punishment upon the unworthy shall be more painful than they had ever imagined..."

  mot_dhr_wait_and_see:0 ""Wait And See""
  mot_dhr_wait_and_see_desc:0 "I came across some graffiti from before the chaos in the NCR. How simple it was back then, to be known only as 'General Wait-And-See'. I've grown tired, but I also won the election, despite my opponents having much better plans for the future than I did. I suppose I owe it to the Californian people to finish the job."
  mot_dhr_leave_behind:0 "Wouldn't It Be Nice?"
  mot_dhr_leave_behind_desc:0 "I've been thinking a lot as of late, about how my nation will be remembered in a decade. In a century. Will it stand the test of time? Or crumble to dust the moment I am gone? I don't know how the future will be, but I need to do a little bit more to ensure all this doesn't reflect the last days of the NCR."
  mot_dhr_dear_cali:0 "California Love"
  mot_dhr_dear_cali_desc:0 "Working with the group I worked with, I sometimes think back on if I could have done something different. In my relapse of paranoia, I sometimes think they're preparing to circumvent my authority. To kill me in my sleep. And then I wake up, to reassurances that nothing is wrong, that it was all a bad dream. I've been living a bad dream for the last few months. All I want is to sleep without fear."

  mot_dhr_fist_desc:0 "Taking down the Brotherhood, doing what I did with Moore, ensuring chaos would never erupt in the nation ever again. It all shows signs of me becoming another Brotherhood, another Caesar, doesn't it? No. I need to be better than them. We need to offer our advanced technology to every man, woman, and child. We need to slowly wane off our revised patriotic history and teach people the realities of what happened. But not right now."
  mot_dhr_strong:0 "That’ll Be the Day"
  mot_dhr_strong_desc:0 "Passing by the portraits of previous NCR Presidents, now half burned and charred since the chaos, it makes me wonder if I ever needed to prove myself to them. Before House was killed, he talked about his belief of my public disgrace, that I was more liable to kill myself than to see the NCR to the end. But with Kimball dead, and my slow rebuilding of the nation, the great thinker found that the odds of the Californian public supporting a full-scale re-invasion was quite high. And I'm quite proud of that."

  mot_dhr_real_human_bean_desc:0 "This has been a long time coming. I can't sit in a dark and dingy office, or stand and give grand speeches to a public that has long tired of them. I need to take off my President-General's cap and take a walk. Hanlon always talked about retiring. In another life... another world, I may have taken him up on that offer alongside him. But he's gone now. I'm not. But it seems he did leave me one last gift. Two coffee cups, from the south. One smells bitter, the other sweet. Which will I drink? Or will I not drink at all?"

  mot_dhr_sub_sole_desc:0 "'There is nothing new under the sun.' But it doesn't have to be like that, does it? All the philosophers will say that the NCR died, that the victory of Oliver's military force was nothing but luck. Maybe it was. And maybe it was also a sign that we don't need to have history repeat. That there can be new things under the sun. We just were looking backwards or upside down the whole time."

Never was a botanist, but I'm sure some folks in Hayes' plant research department, or his attempts at refurbishing the EPA, will be able to harness, or at least stabilize, whatever it was that made these... things. Worse comes to worst, we place another couple signs that say for people not to enter, and deny allegations of plant-people being used as fertilizer or food substitutes."

  mot_dhr_auld_lang_syne_desc:0 "My father... his Devil's Brigade... they were here this whole time.

The ghoul, the Super Mutant, humans that look, talk, and act identical to us, with the difference of a single eye, an extra arm, or a few extra fingers and toes? We need to be better than those that came before. Tandi had some good ideas, but those good ideas eroded for the sake of lining rich pockets, and giving excuses to racists.

  mot_dhr_definition_of_humanity_desc:0 "If there was one thing that was unanimously looked upon as being for better rather than for worse, it was implant technology. Even the New Vegas medical clinic offered implants. But these... they're a whole different breed of implants. Only thing I'm really worried about is going past a point of no return. Where machines walk the earth, killing man and mutant alike. But with careful guidance, and hopefully the empathy and moral compass of who gets implants, we can ensure a bright future for all humanity."

But sure, Hayes, let's go with your idea of bringing ONE turbine back online... at least it'll only take a short period of time, then we can get back to doing real work."

But it wasn't really war that never changed. It was the people waging it. It was the reasons for which it was being waged. It was how the war was being waged at all. It wasn't just humans bashing each other with clubs for the right of a mate, or determining who gets the food. It was for survival on what they thought was a dying world. Well, it's not dying anymore."

Guess I'm sort of the last remnant of what the NCR once was. And from a faction the OSI was supposed to stomp out and make obsolete. I can't do anything about the retirement of all these people, but I can recover their stories. Tell them to kids. Have those kids pass it on. Maybe settle down with a nice guy. All that's for the future though. War may never have changed... but the men here did. And it made a stronger, loving world for it."
