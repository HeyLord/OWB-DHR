  nf_dhr.5.d:0 "«Should I trust these charlatans?». That was the only thought on Oliver's mind as he waited for the meeting with Richard Goldman, the head of the Church of the Hubulogy. One one hand the rumors about them made them look like a shady cult, but on the other hand the Hubologists were the ones who, in the midst of the chaos in California,  were freely helping the war-torn civilians of California, which Oliver respected.\n\nA knock on the door sounded and Oliver invited the visitor inside.\n"Good day to you, Mr. President General. My name is Richard Goldman. My best friends call me Dick, and I feel that you and I can be the best of friends!"\n\n"I am most grateful to you, Mr. Oliver, for placing your trust in our organization! I suppose you've heard about the San Francisco incident and the Hubologists that were there, but I assure you, we're a completely different organization now!"\n\n"You heard how the Hubologists in San Francisco took away all the belongings of the poor people to join the organization, didn't you? I'll tell you, that's a lot of nerve! It is because of this kind of leadership that the Hubologists are treated as thieves and charlatans!"\n\n"What changed, you ask? Along came me, Richard Goldman, who had wanted to make the Hubologists something better since I was a kid. And so, after our (well-deserved) exile to Eureka, I took the reins, wanting to turn the Hubologists into a legitimate religious organization."\n\n"And so, seeing California in a state of bloody civil war..."\n\nThe flow of words kept pouring out of Dick's mouth, and Oliver began to feel himself falling asleep.\n\nFinally, Dick finished and with a smile on his face extended his hand to Oliver."

  nf_dhr.15.t:0 "Californian Sons"
  nf_dhr.15.d:0 "Oh, warm Mojave air, that turns your throat into a desert, Oliver didn't expect to miss this hell on earth. But this was where he had realized himself as a general and later as a leader during the chaos in California.\n\nOliver coughed, pushing the nostalgia away from him and looked at the people who had gathered to await the unveiling of the new monument that stood behind Oliver, and he looked proudly at the culprit of the celebration.\n\nBefore there had been a monument to the friendship between the NCR and the Desert Rangers, but after the betrayal of Ranger General Mossman (and most likely Oliver's personal dislike of the Rangers), all the current Rangers had been recognized as traitors and disbanded, and the new Rapid Reaction Force under Oliver’s personal control had taken their place. And so one of Oliver's first acts after the Mojave was returned to NCR control was to destroy the monument and begin planning a new memorial worthy of California.\n\n"Californian Son", was how Oliver decided to call it. The monument depicted an NCR soldier with a little slave girl in his arms, that was one of the many victims of the Legion that our soldiers found. Oliver didn't consider himself an art person, but he was proud of how well his idea for the monument came to life.\n\nOliver coughed again, he had been in his musings for too long, you can't keep people waiting too long after all. Oliver adjusted his cap, and began his speech."

  nf_dhr.26.t:0 "Take Me to Church"
  nf_dhr.26.d:0 ""President Oliver! We weren't warned of your arrival, come on in, we always have room for you, come this way."\n\nOliver nodded to the men in gray robes and followed them. Oliver didn't know why he had decided to go to this Church of the Hubologists after all, he vaguely remembered signing the order to build it while Goldman buzzed in his ear describing the need to build a temple in the Hub.\n\nOliver wondered what can he expect from this visit, the outside of the Church was nothing special, but the view inside impressed him greatly. The murals on the walls with starry skies, colorful planets and strange alien creatures seemed to transport him to another world.\n\nOliver was invited to the special guests' area on the second floor, away from the rest of the faithful, and the ceremony began. The priest, whose name was AHS-6, as Oliver was told, began his speech. He congratulated the new faitful on their successful cleansing of the neurodynes ritual and began to tell the story of Dick Hubbell and the founding of the Hubologists to the newcomers.\n\nSitting and hearing all of this for the first time, one thought occurred to Oliver."

  nf_dhr.28.t:0 "Californian Son"
  nf_dhr.28.d:0 "Mojave. Again. Something kept pulling the general back to this place. This time Oliver needed to go to Hoover Dam, but something stirred in him that made him want to make one stop along the way.\n\n"Californian Son" was more than just a name for a monument to the general. It was the ideal of a man, a true protector of California that Oliver had looked up to his entire life. Whether it was his appointment as commander-in-chief of the Mojave operation, his rescue of California from extremists, or his subsequent leadership and rebuilding of the country, Oliver always felt that he was getting closer and closer to being that "Californian Son" even a little bit.\n\nHowever, standing in front of the monument now, Oliver realized exactly how he really felt. Inferiority. Oliver felt inferior in the face of the monument, the ideal he had created. How far he was from the ordinary soldier depicted on the monument, hell, from any soldier in California. What was the point of everything Oliver had done anyway, if the ideal was still so far away from him?\n\nSomeone touched his shoulder and Oliver snapped out of his trance.\n\n"Are you okay Mr. President? We're late for the dam.""
