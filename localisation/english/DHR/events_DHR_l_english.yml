  nf_dhr.1.d:0 "Oliver entered the empty president's office with an elated mood. Despite everything, all those who had doubted the general, he had prevailed and Shady Sands had come under his control. Perhaps the title of "President General" was a bit too much, but Oliver wanted to savor the moment of his victory while he could. He wasn't going to be a dictator like Moore, Oliver would be sure to hold free elections as soon as the situation in California was more stable.\n\nTo his surprise, the president's office hadn't suffered much in all this chaos, only a few things lying on the floor, but overall the office was in order. One of the things lying on the floor caught Oliver's eye. It was a picture frame, but it was face down on the floor, and Oliver suddenly wondered what kind of picture was in it. Bending over and picking up the frame, Oliver turned it over to see the photograph.\n\nOliver knew that photograph. Moreover, a copy of this photograph was in the top left pocket of his uniform. The photo showed two friends, Aaron Kimball and Lee Oliver, in the days when they were still in the Army together. Oliver remembered well how Kimball had pulled a wounded Oliver from the battlefield, and so that he would never forget that moment, Oliver had offered to take a photo of the two of them together.\n\nHe forgot about that photo. How could he forget that? There was no trace of his old smile on Oliver's face. Aaron's dead. Why did the realization of this only come to him now? The thoughts and feelings in Oliver's head jumbled together and he began to feel worse and worse.\n\nOliver slowly walked over to the window of the president room.\nBurning buildings, soldiers breaking into houses looking for the remnants of Moore's soldiers, crying children not understanding all that was happening. Oliver finally saw it. All the things he had subconsciously tried to ignore"

  nf_dhr.2.d:0 "Oliver's announcement that he was leaving Mojave turned everything upside down, and crowds of people tried to get to California any way they could to avoid the Legion. Foreseeing this potential crisis, Oliver, in collaboration with the Followers, meticulously crafted an evacuation strategy for Mojave's inhabitants. Their efforts ensured a welcoming passage to California for everyone, despite the overwhelming number of evacuees...\n\nChoosing to stay in Mojave because the Legion was coming and many would need help, Julia Farkas asked Arcade to lead the evacuation on behalf of the Followers. Although Arcade had never aspired to a leadership position, the dire situation compelled him to step up; abandoning the people in the hour of need was not an option for him.\n\nThus, Arcade embarked on the journey to California, navigating through the remnants of a region still grappling with the scars of Civil War, determined to secure a safer future for those displaced by the conflict."

Along with other congressmen and bureaucrats, he fled to Redding, which remained far from the bloodbath, but Wendell didn't know what fate awaited his California next.\n\nBut something even more unexpected happened when Wendell heard that General Lee Oliver had decided to intervene in the Civil War. Wendell did not know the "protégé of the Hero of the Mojave" well, he knew Kimball better, and Wendell had strong doubts about the success of this campaign.\n\nAnd here Oliver sits before him, asking  for Wendell's help in rebuilding California.\n\nRetirement sounds good, but Wendell loved his country, even if that love was one-sided.\n\nWendell put his glasses back on and held out his hand to Oliver."

  nf_dhr.4.t:0 "No Way to Follow" #Arcade and followers ban
  nf_dhr.4.d:0 "In an unprecedented move, president-general Olver signed a new decree banning the Followers of the Apocalypse organization for “their attempt to destroy California with their terrorist actions in the civil war ”. This decision to prohibit their activities sent shockwaves across the region. In a bid to control and centralize the efforts towards the betterment of the wastelands, the government has announced the formation of a new state-controlled organization named California R&D (Research and Development).\n\nAll former members of the Followers are invited to join this new entity, with promises of ample resources, state backing, and a more focused objective to better the living conditions and technological advancements within California. This monumental shift aims to streamline research and development efforts, ensuring that all projects align with the state's vision for the future.\n\nOne notable member of the Followers, Arcade Gannon, a doctor and a scholar renowned for his intelligence and dedication to the Followers' cause, expressed his reaction to these sweeping changes. Gannon, known for his skepticism towards centralized power and his unwavering commitment to the Followers' ideology of altruism and independence, finds himself at a crossroads.\n\n"It's a bitter pill to swallow," Gannon remarked, his tone a mixture of resignation and resolve. "The Followers have always operated on the fringes, making do with what little we had, driven by the belief that knowledge and aid should be free and accessible to all. This move to a state-controlled entity, while promising resources we could only dream of, also chains us to the agendas and whims of those in power."\n\nGannon continues, "I fear that the spirit of the Followers, the very essence of our quest for knowledge and aid, might be diluted under this new directive. However, the needs of the people remain paramount. If joining California R&D means we can better serve the communities and further our research, then it's a path we must consider, albeit cautiously."\n\nThe transition to California R&D signals a new chapter for the former Followers of the Apocalypse. While it offers opportunities hitherto unimagined, it also tests the ideals and the resolve of its members. As for Arcade Gannon and his fellow Followers, their journey from independent operatives to state-endorsed agents is fraught with uncertainty, hope, and a determination to remain true to their core values amidst changing tides."

One one hand the rumors about them made them look like a shady cult, but on the other hand the Hubologists were the ones who, in the midst of the chaos in California,  were freely helping the war-torn civilians of California, which Oliver respected.\n\nA knock on the door sounded and Oliver invited the visitor inside.\n"Good day to you, Mr. President General. My name is Richard Goldman. My best friends call me Dick, and I feel that you and I can be the best of friends!"\n\n"I am most grateful to you, Mr. Oliver, for placing your trust in our organization! I suppose you've heard about the San Francisco incident and the Hubologists that were there, but I assure you, we're a completely different organization now!"\n\n"You heard how the Hubologists in San Francisco took away all the belongings of the poor people to join the organization, didn't you? I'll tell you, that's a lot of nerve! It is because of this kind of leadership that the Hubologists are treated as thieves and charlatans!"\n\n"What changed, you ask? Along came me, Richard Goldman, who had wanted to make the Hubologists something better since I was a kid. And so, after our (well-deserved) exile to Eureka, I took the reins, wanting to turn the Hubologists into a legitimate religious organization."\n\n"And so, seeing California in a state of bloody civil war..."\n\nThe flow of words kept pouring out of Dick's mouth, and Oliver began to feel himself falling asleep.\n\nFinally, Dick finished and with a smile on his face extended his hand to Oliver."

Dick had long ago noticed this dilapidated observatory, and having applied to the President General for funds, (during his pitch about which, as Richard observed, the President had fallen asleep) his request had been granted.\n\nDick had chosen this place not so much because of the location, but because of one thing that caught his eye. Almost untouched by time and war, a huge telescope beckoned Richard to it by its mere sight. Ever since he was a child, a desire to see the starry sky up close had been burning in him, and now it had finally come true.\n\nRichard, however, wanted to see more than just the stars. As a child, he once witnessed a miracle that he considered a blessing from his Star Father. On a dark night, Richard saw a bizarre round ship that flew over his head and disappeared in an instant. The apparition strengthened his faith in Hubology, but he didn't tell about it to anyone. He believed that the leaders were twisting Dick Hubbell's words, trying to profit from the people of the Wasteland, who would never have known the light of the Star Father if Richard had not come to power. There was no point in being angry with them now, Star Father had punished them, and only he, Richard Goldman, had risen as a true believer.\n\nSuddenly there was a loud explosion in the sky above Dick's head. Almost falling from his chair, he quickly reached for the telescope and what he saw in it threw Richard into a stupor.\nThe same bizarre round ship was falling from the sky, surrounded by fire. Dick could see the spot into which the ship was falling, and he reached excitedly for his radio."

All Oliver cared about as a military man was that you could hold a gun and follow orders, and everything else was secondary.\n\nBut the supermutants...\n\nOliver had some doubts about them. He had heard stories that an army of super mutants had threatened California in the past, and were generally unfriendly to all other species.

And so one of Oliver's first acts after the Mojave was returned to NCR control was to destroy the monument and begin planning a new memorial worthy of California.\n\n"Californian Son", was how Oliver decided to call it. The monument depicted an NCR soldier with a little slave girl in his arms, that was one of the many victims of the Legion that our soldiers found. Oliver didn't consider himself an art person, but he was proud of how well his idea for the monument came to life.\n\nOliver coughed again, he had been in his musings for too long, you can't keep people waiting too long after all.

But Richard replied with a smile that although we are Hubologists, we are in democratic California, and we can only elect a leader democratically, at the end of his term, which quieted the desire to make Dara a new leader here and now.\n\nToward the end of the celebration, Richard announced the creation of a Museum of Hubology, where a detailed history of our religion will be on display, as well as many of the artifacts we have found in California and on our pilgrimage."

  nf_dhr_dick.5.d:0 ""Brothers and sisters, as we know the ways of the Star Father are inscrutable, but he always rewards those who believe.\n\nOur predecessors were banished from San Francisco many years ago, so punished by Star Father for their greed and ambition, and their sins nearly destroyed the Hubologists.\n\nBut the Star Father, in his infinite wisdom, did not forsake us. Instead, He bestowed upon us His visionary, Richard Goldman. Under his guidance, we have surmounted enumerable adversities that once impeded our path.\n\nThe gracious citizens of California have perceived the merits of our altruistic deeds, a recognition reflected in the honor they have endowed upon me by conferring the mantle of President. Rest assured, ladies and gentlemen, under my stewardship, Hubology will ascend to unprecedented heights of enlightenment. May our radiance illuminate even the darkest corners, and may those who have yet to embrace our truths be awestruck by our divine luminescence."

  nf_dhr_dick.6.d:0 ""All systems are ready for the launch."\n\nTo lift a UFO into the air is impossible, but Richard Goldman had faith, and faith is the basis of any religion. But he didn't use his faith alone, Richard gathered the best of the best: various scientists from the NCR, nations all across the wastelands, the Enclave remnants, everyone likes money and money was no problem for the Hubologists. Richard spared no expense to launch this saucer into the air.\n\nDara Hubbell volunteered to pilot the ESS Quetzel during this test flight, and even though Richard was discouraged from doing so, the ship was untested and it would be extremly dangerous.  But Richard agreed, after all if something went wrong, he would have one less problem to deal with.\n\nAnd so she climbed into the cockpit, and Richard looked at the saucer, and at Dara in particular. Finally Dara took her position in the cockpit.\n\nRichard picked up the walkie-talkie.\n\n"Start it."\n\nThe ESS Quetzel rumbled into life, momentarily hovering a few meters alof..\n\n...Followed swiftly by a catastrophic detonation, the concussive force knocking off their feet the scientists and Richard in the viewing gallery.\n\nAmidst a sea of shattered glass, Richard found himself grounded, the stark ceiling above framed by a grin of satisfaction. Though disaster had struck, there remained a silver lining..."

  nf_dhr_dick.7.d:0 ""Friends, I hasten to tell you that our sister, Dara Hubbell, has achieved exaltation, by his will she deserves to live on the planet, for her good deeds and those of our founder.\n\nYet, our journey towards transcendence is far from over. It is our collective duty to strive relentlessly for our own spiritual upliftment.\n\nHow could we possibly conceive of soaring to the heavens while leaving countless souls groping in the shadows? There exist many who have yet to witness the luminous grace of the Star Father, with some even spurning His radiant wisdom. It would be inconceivable for us, in our compassion, to forsake these individuals to a fate devoid of light. To this I say, my dear brothers and sisters, abandonment is not our path. We will endeavor tirelessly to ensure that every stretch of earth, every single soul, is bathed in the Star Father’s incandescent embrace.\n\nWhat will happen to those who will not accept the light no matter what? A foolish question, brothers and sisters, you know what we do to the Rim Meat.\n\nCome on brothers and sisters, we have a lot of work to do.""

  nf_dhr.21.t:0 "Electioneering" #Arcade victory
  nf_dhr.21.d:0 "The results had come in. In a resounding landslide not seen since the Tandi era, the leader of California Research and Development, Arcade Israel Gannon, had won. He had never anticipated to be on the ballot, let alone win. But it seemed as though his intelligent nature and the high regards both refugees, intellectuals, and the common man alike, had seen an unprecedented call by the Followers for his leadership. Had he wished, he'd have abdicated the position to Hayes, but he was away on another 'expedition'.\n\nHe thought back to the various holovids of Roman leadership, to his readings of various history books. He wouldn't become another Caesar, but what was he in comparison to Octavian, Caesarion, or even Edward Sallow?\n\nHis eyes fell on a portrait of Kimball. The warhawk. The male domineering President. Would he stand to be better than him? He knew well of the realities of the wasteland, that even the Followers had to admit at one point that pacifism simply wasn't an option. He was sure Tandi had been in a similar bind herself, after all, she had to deal with Vault City xenophobes and New Reno mafia dons.\n\nUltimately, he placed his hand down on something that had been consistent to him his entire life: His heart. All he could tell himself is that he would do his best."

  nf_dhr.22.d:0 "Westside was bustling with activity. Ever since the defeat of the Fiends, the fall of the NCR, and the Legion finally being gone for good, the outside of what was once House's Strip was now in a mix of fearing the end of days, and celebrating a newly independent Mojave.\nHowever, nobody paid attention as President-Elect (or simply President) Gannon strolled through the district. Watching for a distinctive red baseball cap, Gannon surveyed the area.\n\n"Never thought I'd get to say these words again, but... what can I do you for, Mr. President?"\n\nTurning around, Gannon witnessed as the aged Captain put a hand up to his cap in a formal salute.\nArcade sighed. "I'm thinking about getting the Brigade back together."\n\nPlacing his fingers on his white-haired lip, Judah Kreger twirled it. "I seem to recall a certain man, now President-Elect, remarking about how us Enclave folk were nothing more than a... what was it? Ah, right. 'Fascist paramilitary organization'."\n\nArcade rolled his eyes. "I'm very well aware of how I think about things. But it's in that thinking that I realized something. Good, evil, light, dark. It's relative. You strived to be good people in service of bringing a dead dream, a dead nation, back to live. You kept the band together alongside my father for years. I turned you all away in fear that you were the objective evil spoken about in centuries-old textbooks and holotapes."\n\nJudah side-eyed the Follower. "And now Mr. California needs us fascist paramilitary men in his service?"\n\nRolling his eyes once more, Arcade indicated to the bustling crowd of Westside. "Legion isn't around anymore, neither is House. And neither is Kimball. I'm their leader now. Even if I have a face too generic to recognize out in public. I know how much of a hypocrite this makes me sound, but think about it. You're not serving the NCR, you're not serving the Enclave, you're serving me. Like you served my father."\n\n"And what makes you think that'll be enough to bring Moreno or Daisy or Johnson back?"\n\nArcade turned around, the sun's glare reflecting off the lens of his glasses."

  nf_dhr_news.1.d:0 "Shocking news comes to us from Mojave. Today, General Oliver, who has been running the local contingent of NCR troops in Mojave, announced a complete withdrawal from the territory to focus all forces on rebuilding California after the Civil War and fighting the remaining "traitors to California," as the General stated. The General continued his speech by saying that he understood the fear of the locals of the Legion forces that would undoubtedly take over Mojave as soon as the troops were withdrawn, and therefore announced a humanitarian operation in cooperation with the Followers, allowing all civilians to leave Mojave for California. California soldiers would securely guard the refugee convoys, Oliver promised. The general concluded by promising that he would not leave Mojave in the hands of the Legion and would return as soon as California was under his full control."
