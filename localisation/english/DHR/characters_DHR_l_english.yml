  LNS_dustdevil_dan_air_chief_desc:0 "Once upon a time, the name "Dustdevil" meant something in the state of Texas. As the oil fields dried up in the 2050s, the people of the Texas Commonwealth needed something to take their mind off the impending collapse of one of their biggest industries, and so it came to be that the Dustdevil family took to the skies, flying every which way, attracting bigger and bigger crowds, until they were one of the biggest airplane daredevil groups north of the border.\n\nDan was the youngest, always dreaming of flying with his folks. Until the Great War came and took them away from him. They had left early in the morning for a stunt show in Houston. Dan had been on his own ever since, left with a General Atomics turboprop stunt plane, a forgotten family business, and a desire only to take to the skies once more.\n\nA desire that was answered when he was encountered by a wayward Lonestar lawman patrol, attempting to salvage his plane for parts. One Texan standoff later, Dan was on his way to living his dream."

Now a representative of the Ghoul Trading Company, Pete makes his money squarely, although some unscrupulous practices have been reported by customers, such as selling them inferior quality tobacco (actually marijuana) and weapons that cease working should they not purchase a warranty.\n\nPete also claims that he is a personal friend of Cho Bang, if only through the 'mutual friendship of capitalism', but maintains a level of professionalism that, for all his flaws, is loved and preferred by the people of Lone Star. Plus it keeps his brothers off his back, assuming they're even alive..."

  LNS_ralph_murdok_research_advisor_desc:0 "A representative of the Texan Brotherhood, Murdok was initially sent as a means of maintaining technological progression within Lonestar, ensuring that the nation would not reach the Pre-War levels of decadence that were responsible for the Great War. But as he continued to be stationed in the area, he realized he could put his efforts to better use in teaching the rugged and ragged lawmen, patrols, and garrisons, who had all the experience of a Brotherhood Initiate on a bad day, into being a force that were not only a fear in quantity, but also feared in their tactical prowess.\n\nHis methods have been drawn to criticism, as some within the Brotherhood believe that the tactics are meant only for tribals and 'savages', rather than the civilized people Texas proclaims itself to develop.\n\nMurdok couldn't care less, bow or beam, Lonestar won't be a name that will be forgotten anytime soon."

Putting out a call for those experienced in the ways of warfare (that could actually teach others and not kill them), the first dozen applicants were all turned down, some for a lack of application of their so-called tactics, others for simply seeking a reward for approaching the Warlord and showing off their newest weapon.\n\nThat was, until a raider by the name of Wound Breeder approached. Utilizing the dozen failed applicants as an example, the Wound divided them into two pairs, pitting them against each other, one to be led by the Warlord, the other led by the Wound.\n\nThe Wound won.\n\nThe Warlord, as humiliated as he may have been, made the Wound their tactician in a heartbeat."
